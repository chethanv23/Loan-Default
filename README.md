New applicants for loan application can also be evaluated on these 8 predictor variables and classified as a default or non-default based on predictor variables


Steps followed in the project:

1)Exploratory Data Analysis
  •	Missing Value Analysis
  •	Outlier Analysis
  
2)Feature selection

3)Feature scaling

4)Model Development
  •	Test Train Split
  •	Logistic Regression
  •	Model Evaluation

•	Performed Logistic regression on the data set and evaluated the model with the help of confusion matrix.

•	Model accuracy stands at 83.57% , with specificity 93%.
